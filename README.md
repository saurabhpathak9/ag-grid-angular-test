# Angular5 AG Grid Test with Springboot and SockJS/STOMP!
Hello Everyone, I tried to test AG Grid with heavy load with Middle Tier running as spring boot app exposing Websocket using SockJS and STOMP. 
**Learning Reference**: Spring Website, AG Grid Documentation, Angular.io

# Files
Run Springboot app code from spring-boot folder in your favorite IDE (Eclipse/Idea) with Java 8.
